# Bank Account Management System (Java)

## 📌 Overview
The **Bank Account Management System** is a console-based Java mini project designed to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
It simulates basic banking operations for different account types such as **Savings Account**, **Current Account**, and **Fixed Deposit Account**.

This project is ideal for beginners and freshers to understand real-world application of OOP concepts in Java.
